### I. Introduction
#### 1. RFM Analysis
- RFM method is a marketing analysis tool used to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. It helps businesses identify and understand their most valuable customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
  + Recency: Measures how recently a customer has made a purchase.
  + Frequency: Measures how often a customer makes purchases within a specific time frame.
  + Monetary Value: Measures the total amount a customer has spent during their relationship with the business.
- RFM analysis helps businesses identify high-value and at-risk customers, enabling them to prioritize retention efforts, launch targeted win-back campaigns, and improve decision-making and personalization through data-driven insights.

#### 2. Business questions
- The Marketing department seeks to segment this yearâ€™s large customer base to run targeted campaigns but can no longer process the data manually as in previous years.
- They aim to thank loyal customers and identify potential ones who could become more engaged.
- The Marketing Director has proposed using the RFM model, and the Data Analytics team has been tasked with building an automated Python-based solution due to the dataset's scale.

#### Segmentation table

- Since the focus is on analyzing customer segments, we need to remove data missing in the 'CustomerID' column. Additionally, to calculate available orders and using RFM method we will retain only positive values in the 'UnitPrice' and 'Quantity' columns.
- Applying the RFM method: calculate the R, F, and M scores for each customer and then develop a scoring framework based on a 1-to-5 scale. Using the statistical method of quintile analysis is recommended for this purpose.
- Combine the segmentation table with the customer data to assign each customer their status

### IV.Insights
1. Among three index R, F, M that the company needs to pay attention to, (R) should be the immediate focus because the company has a total of 32.39% of customers in the At Risk (9.87%), Hibernating (16%), and About to Sleep (6.52%) categories. These groups indicate a high risk of churn, which can significantly impact revenue.
2. Loyal (9.80%, contributing $1,015,513.33), Potential Loyalists (9.50%, contributing $225,247.60), Promising (3.14%, contributing $121,031.35), and Need Attention (6.41%, contributing $461,077.53). Increasing the frequency of purchases in these groups could drive sustained growth. => index (F) should be the next focus, this needs improvement to ensure sustained growth.
3. Monetary (M) insights show most customers spend minimally (under $50,000 USD). However, Champions (19.20%) drive 62.85% of total sales ($5,600,439.80), far exceeding other segments. Loyal (11.40%, $1,015,513.33) and Potential Loyalists (2.53%, $225,247.60) also contribute significantly but remain secondary compared to Champions.
4. Champions (19.20%) drive 62.85% of total sales, while Loyal (11.40%) and Potential Loyalists (2.53%) contribute a valuable share of revenue. The focus should be on boosting spending from low-value, high-frequency segments through targeted promotions or premium bundles to increase overall revenue.
5. Hibernating customers, making up 16% of the base, generate just 3.20% of total sales ($285,314.97), highlighting their low engagement and monetary contribution.
6. While smaller in customer proportion, segments like Cannot Lose Them (2.30%, $205,324.72) and At Risk (8.55%, $761,560.87) contribute a disproportionately high share of sales compared to other segments. These groups present a strong case for retention efforts.
